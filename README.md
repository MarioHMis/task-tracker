# TaskTrackCLI

TaskTrackCLI is a lightweight command-line application built with Java as part of my personal portfolio. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding, listing, updating, filtering, and deleting them through a clean and intuitive text-based interface. All tasks are stored persistently using JSON, with support for status tracking and timestamps.

## Features

- ðŸ“‹ Task creation with automatic timestamps
- âœ… Status management: TODO, IN_PROGRESS, DONE
- ðŸ”¢ Task selection by number (no need to enter long IDs)
- ðŸ§¹ Delete tasks easily
- ðŸ”Ž Filter tasks by status
- ðŸ’¾ Persistent storage using JSON with automatic backup
- ðŸ§ª Includes basic unit tests with JUnit 5
- ðŸš€ Packaged as an executable JAR

## Requirements

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.8 or higher
